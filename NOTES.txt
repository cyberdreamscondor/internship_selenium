* All widgets are present.
    if not, refresh & recheck BUT refreshing the page may change user currently logged in.
    let's not refresh, doesn't make sense here.


Time at work widget:
--------------------

* stopwatch button leads to 'Attendance' -> taking into consideration this is a practice site,
first read the widget attendace details then make sure correspondant 'attendance' page(punch in/out) opens.
Normally there's some data stored about the user and it is reflected on the widget, but that data is
completely uncontrollable.

* all elements located, default data is correct

* impossible to 'punch in/out' without obligatory data
* click'n'type everything on date/time input fields then 'Punch in/out'
* widget attendance details show latest actoin with correct info
* working hours for today == <current time> - <punched in>
* chart shows correct data
* resize window, check widget behavior
